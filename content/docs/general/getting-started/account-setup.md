# Account Setup

These are the essential tools you'll need to set up the first day. You'll receive an invitation email for most of them, but if you have any trouble getting into the accounts, let us know, and we'll help you.

## **Google Workspace**

We use [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) as our primary service for, well, everything. Your new **firstname.lastname@dualbootpartners.com** email is a Google account and will give you access to all its services: Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and others.

<aside>
⚠️ Please make sure you set up 2 step verification; otherwise, your account will get blocked in 15 days.

## Slack

Email is dead! Nah, not really, but we use Slack as our primary communication tool on a daily basis. We use it for work, for integrating services that notify us of important things, and of course, for sending random [gifs](https://thecodinglove.com/).

You'll receive invites for our two workspaces. Please join both, as you'll be working with them daily.

<aside>
⚠️ To join both Workspaces, you will need to select ***"create an account"*** in both cases. 
Yeah, Slack is a bit strange 😖

**LATAM** - [latamdualbootpartners.slack.com](http://latamdualbootpartners.slack.com/) 🇺🇾  🇦🇷  🇨🇺  🇻🇪

Main workspace you'll be using everyday. Used for internal communication, in general in Spanish.

Channels you might want to join:

- [#team-engineering](https://latamdualbootpartners.slack.com/archives/C01U6V8G39S): for everything related to engineering questions, events, etc.
- [#team-design](https://latamdualbootpartners.slack.com/archives/C01U0QGTPU2): all about design.

- [#team-product](https://latamdualbootpartners.slack.com/archives/C01V9N9E5K2): product design & product management stuff

**Worldwide** - [dualbootpartners.slack.com](http://dualbootpartners.slack.com/) 🇺🇸

This is a global and client-focused workspace where everyone is in, including the US and Russia teams. We don't use this workspace for global communication; here, we have shared channels to communicate with our clients.

Slack is a great communication tool, but make sure you [set up notifications correctly](https://slack.com/intl/en-uy/help/articles/201355156-Configure-your-Slack-notifications#notification-triggers) to reduce noise and distractions.

## Toggl track

We know it; everyone hates tracking hours. But as you can imagine, it plays a pretty important role in our business model. But don't panic; it's not that bad as it sounds. [Toggl track](https://toggl.com/track/) is a pretty simple tool for tracking hours, and it won't consume much of your time. You'll receive an invitation for Toggl in your email. Take a look at the [Time tracking](https://www.notion.so/Time-tracking-568209766296485cbecc4a0c8a93f63f)  section to learn how to report your hours.
