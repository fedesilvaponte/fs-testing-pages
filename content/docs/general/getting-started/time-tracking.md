# Time Tracking

Alright, you're here. As you know, this is a boring but crucial task we need to do to run our business. **We recommend updating your hours daily** if possible, as it's a considerable less effort than thinking back on your hours from the past days. Here's a simple guide on how to track your hours.

<aside>

See how to create a reminder [here](https://slack.com/intl/en-uy/help/articles/208423427-Set-a-reminder).

### Track mode

We suggest using the Manual tracking mode, as it's simpler and you don't need to remember to toggle on or off the switch.

It doesn't really matter **when** those hours are entered, as we don't care about the time of the day. Just make sure you add your **working time for the day,** and that's it. Don't consider lunch time.

<aside>
‚è∞ In most of the cases, you just need to **add one entry per day** for the project you are working in. If you are in multiple projects, just add one entry per project per day.

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Each week make sure you are entering, at least 40 hours. This will help a lot when reviewing hours and creating invoices for the clients.

</aside>

**Edge cases**

- If you happen to work a specific day more than 8 hours, please register those.
- If you work less than 8 hours for whatever reason, remember to complete the total 8 hours for the day using an internal project. Check "Special hours" section at the bottom of this page.

### Description

It's important to be accurate with the task description as it goes directly into the invoice we send to the client. If we have fussy description we might face some push back from them, so it's way better to do it right from the start. To keep things simple we recommend the following structure:

**With a related ticket on any issue-tracking tool (GitLab, Azure Devops, Jira)**

<aside>
‚úçÔ∏è [# ticket identifier] - [Comment]

</aside>

*Example 1: PR1-2023 - Model change for database entity*

*Example 2: Work on tickets PR1-172, PR1-312, PR-145*

**Without a related ticket**

<aside>
‚úçÔ∏è [General comment]

</aside>

*Example: Kickoff meeting with client*

### Project association

This is the most important part. If a task is not assigned to a project, it won't be considered billable and won't appear in the reports, therefore, it won't be sent to clients.

Make sure you tag the project (or task) you are working in by clicking in the folder icon.

<aside>
üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you haven't been assigned to your project in Toggl, let the anyone in the team know and they get you access.

### Special **hours**

Of course, there are cases where some hours should not go to clients' projects, but it's still important to track the time. Use these Internal projects to assign hours for the following occasions:

**Internal - Sick**

For tracking time when you are sick or if you have a medical condition that is not allowing you to work. No need to add a description in this case.

**Internal - Holiday & Vacation**

For when you are on holiday, take some time off, or when there's a national holiday. Again, no need to add description here. If possible, register this time the day before you go out for holidays or vacations.

**Internal - Study day**

For when you have the day off for study. Again, no need to add description here. If possible, register this time the day before you go out.

**Internal - Other Non billable Time**

Use this project to register any **working time** not assigned to a specific project. This can be time dedicated to learning, internal company meetings or internal projects and tasks. In this case, please add a description.

**Internal - Non Working Time**

If you are not a full time employee, please use this project to complete the 8 hours a day required. For example, if you work 6 hours, **add an entry with 6 hours assigned to the project** you're working in, and **complete the day with a 2 hour entry** in Internal - Non Working Time.

**Internal - Bench**

There are some times that while a project ends and a project starts, we do not have an assigned project. In most cases, if this happens, we will be doing some type of training or helping in another project but not actually working on it. If this is the case, you should track your hours in Internal - Bench.

**Internal - Training**

Some of us, when we join the company, we spend some time doing training courses in order to get the knowledge of some technologies that we do not know. If you are in that situation please track your hours in Internal - Training.
