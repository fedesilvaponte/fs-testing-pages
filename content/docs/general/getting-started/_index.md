## Hello human, welcome to Dualboot Partners.

> Afoot and light-hearthed I take to the open road. Healthy, free, the world before me. The long brown path before me. Leading wherever I choose. 

We are thrilled and grateful that you joined our company, and we hope we can give you the opportunities you are looking for.

Getting started at a new company can be overwhelming. There are many little details, some big tasks, you're learning a new job and meeting new coworkers, and you might be doing this remotely. This [handbook](https://www.notion.so/Handbook-bb36bc6fa6fb40859741001c1de58a37) and the whole [team](https://www.notion.so/Who-does-what-2fee42bc5a75466ea6ee9c6f3445c8bf) are here to help.

## Your buddy

{{< columns >}}

Though everyone in the team is willing to help you get onboarded, it's always nice to have a dedicated person to guide you in these first steps. They'll introduce themselves, and they are totally willing to point you in the right direction when you need it.

If you don't know who's your work buddy at this point, we did something wrong! Please let us know.

Before we start, let's make sure we have some things covered.

### Contract

You should have received the work contract for your revision from HR. During the [onboarding](https://www.notion.so/Onboarding-4a821e8dd19c4b91ac5490ea5ec8dbdc) meeting, we will revise the work contract and make sure everything is clear to proceed with the signature.

### Computer setup (if necessary, Windows)

By now, you should have received your new laptop. Just as a chef needs to chop the onions, you'll need to finish the laptop setup :). With your new @dualbootpartners.com email (Microsoft account), you'll need to complete the Windows setup wizard. If you haven't received the account yet, please ping your buddy.

### Computer setup (if necessary, Mac)

We don't know yet ðŸ˜•. We'll figure it out.
