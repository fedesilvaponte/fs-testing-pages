# Personal Brand

Everyone in the team is aware you are joining the company; now it's your turn to present yourself. Time to shine!

## **Tell us who you are**

It's always good to see who we are working with, and you know, a picture is worth a thousand words :). Please share a photo of yourself with HR so they can share it in the **#general** channel in **[Slack LATAM](http://latamdualbootpartners.slack.com)** workspace.

Follow up your photo with a brief description of yourself. We want to know who you are and what you like. Apart from your role at the company, we'd love to hear about your interests, hobbies, anything you want to tell us.

üì∏ In the first couple of weeks, we'll coordinate to get you the "official" Dualboot Partners photo :D. Our official photographer, Andres, will get you a great profile picture!

## **Set up your Slack**

Please configure your Slack profile so it's easy for anyone to know about you. For the display name, make sure you use your full name, or at least something that's recognizable for everyone.

Remember to set the timezone correctly to avoid getting bothered outside of working hours.

## Other services

As you start creating accounts for different service like Google, Microsoft, Gitlab, Jira, etc., try to also set the profile picture there, as it helps the team identify the different users easier.

## Linkedin

If you use Linkedin, and if you'd like to update your profile, here's how you can do it:

1) Add an entry to your experience section with your role. Use [Dualboot Partners](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dualbootpartners/mycompany/) as the company
