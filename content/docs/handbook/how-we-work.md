# How We Work

Among other things, it's likely you are here with us because of our way of working.

We do our best to ensure that everybody can work however and wherever they think is more convenient, and that's why we make remote working a standard practice in the company. "**Work from anywhere**" is not a trend or something inevitable we were forced to do; it's just another practice we have to achieve work-life balance. That being said, there's an important reason why we have offices: culture. We strongly believe in the idea of building teams, learning from others, and fostering innovation. Working in a shared space and meeting face to face is vital to achieving all of this. That's why we encourage people to go to the office, meet others and enjoy some ground coffee or mate.

ðŸ˜· **ATTENTION!** Due to the current situation, we are not encouraging people to go to the offices. They are open in case you need a place to work, but please take care of yourself and others, and follow the established health protocols.

Remote work has countless benefits, and we want everybody to make use of them. At the same time, it comes with specific challenges that we try to mitigate using tools and practices that make our work easier.

Take into consideration that we do calls with our clients, so you need to have fast and reliable internet and a presentable background for the videocalls.

We believe in responsibility. We are all adults. As long as work gets done, we donâ€™t care where you do it from.

## Balance

We limit ourselves to a 40-hour work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters. A healthy amount of sleep and a rich and rewarding life outside of work should not be squandered for a few more hours at work.

There are occasions where teams or individuals need to work off-hours for on-call, maintenance or emergencies. This time should not be in addition to your normal working hours. Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week.

## M**anagers of one**

We have an extremely [horizontal organization](https://www.notion.so/Who-does-what-2fee42bc5a75466ea6ee9c6f3445c8bf) and that's why we rely on everyone to do a lot of self-management. People who do this well qualify asÂ managers of one, and we strive for everyone senior or above to embody this principle fully.

That means setting your own direction when one isnâ€™t given. Determining what needs to be done, and doing it, without waiting for someone to tell you to. A manager of one will spend their time well when left to their own devices. Thereâ€™s always more work to be done, always more initiatives to kick off, always more improvement to be had.

## Communication-first approach

At Dualboot, we believe communication is the key to success in our business, and our clients value this a lot. Take a look at the [Communication](https://www.notion.so/Communication-231a6e4794814abbad5efa2bee68c76f) section to learn more.

Despite we are a remote-first company, we also have some in-real-life rituals, please take a look here [Our rituals](https://www.notion.so/Our-rituals-c7dc0f395b7d468ea5befc789f9197d6)
