# Why a handbook

In early-stage startups and small companies, it's particularly tempting to avoid a documentation strategy. With only a few team members, it's feasible to keep everyone informed via meetings, Slack, or email threads. Long-term, this approach becomes increasingly harmful and inefficient.

As a company matures and starts developing proven processes and practices, a documentation strategy becomes vital to gather that knowledge and spread it across the company in an organized fashion. For *[remote-first](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/)* companies like us, or under exceptional circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic, this is even more important, as the challenge for consolidating know-how, tools, and processes is inherently more complicated.

A handbook-first approach gives team members the benefit of a single source of truth, allowing the company to operate very efficiently. On the other hand, an organization that does *not* put effort into structured documentation has no choice but to watch its team members ask and re-ask for the same bits of data in perpetuity, creating a torturous loop of interruptions, meetings, and suboptimal knowledge transfers.

### **Handbook first**

Documenting something in the handbook before taking action requires more time because you need to think about where to make the change, what processes it impacts, who should be involved, and probably refactor some part of the existing documentation. But, it saves time and some meetings in the long run, and is essential to our ability to scale the company.

Having a **"handbook first"** mentality helps to reduce duplication; the handbook is always up to date, and others are better able to contribute.

# How to use it

1. Guidelines in this handbook are meant to help, and in general, are not intended to be absolute rules. Use them as reference and inspiration, and don't be afraid to propose changes. Be kind when reminding people about these guidelines. For example, say, "It is not a problem, but next time, please consider the following guideline from the handbook."
2. If you need to ask a team member for help, please realize that there is a good chance the majority of the community also doesn't know the answer. Be sure to **document** the response so everyone can learn from it. Discuss with the team where's the best place to record this new information.
3. When discussing something in chat, try to **link** to a URL where relevant. For example, if you have doubts about a topic, share the pages pertinent to it so people can have context.
4. When communicating something always include a link to the relevant (and up-to-date) part of the **handbook** instead of including the text in the email/chat/etc. You can remind other people of this by asking "Can you please link to the relevant part of the handbook?"
5. Remember, the handbook is live documentation and is constantly changing. It's a representation of what we are doing now as a company, but it's not necessarily a representation of what we should do. We expect everyone to contribute, so feel free to propose changes and enhance the handbook. **Check out the "how to contribute guide."**
