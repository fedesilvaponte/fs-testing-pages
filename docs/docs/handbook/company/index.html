Culture
<a class=anchor href=#culture>#</a>
</h1>
<p>We strongly believe that culture is the main driver of our success. It&rsquo;s been fundamental for our ability to hire new people and grow the company and at the same time it&rsquo;s been key for the great results of our projects.</p>
<p>For us, culture is not something we can enforce by buying a ping pong table; yeah it&rsquo;s fun, but it&rsquo;s definitely more than that. Culture is everything we can do collectively to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure our team can achieve work-life balance</li>
<li>Grow professionaly as an invidual</li>
<li>Create a great working environment to foster creativity, innovation and to make work fun and challenging.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=these-are-the-pillars-of-our-company-culture>
These are the pillars of our company culture
<a class=anchor href=#these-are-the-pillars-of-our-company-culture>#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remote first</strong>: Our company is mainly remote. As such, we devise all our workflows and projects to adapt to our remoteness, and every decision we take should not compromise this policy and mindset. That being said, we believe human interaction is of paramount importance for creating a culture, generating ideas, and of course, making friends. Our offices are always available for everyone to enjoy, to have a place to meet with colleagues, to have meetings or simply to have some good nice ground coffee.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Trust is one of our core values, and we believe in openness to provide more honesty and trust to our clients and our team. Transparency is how we hold ourselves accountable and how we learn from our mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomy</strong>: if there&rsquo;s one thing everyone that work with us value is the autonomy each of us have to make decisions at all levels. The same trust our client have with us, we have it among our team. We are a very horizontal organization and that puts responsibility in everyone&rsquo;s shoulders, but that&rsquo;s what makes a career at Dualboot challenging and interesting.</li>
<li><strong>Exceed expectations</strong>: We believe in going the extra mile for everything we do. We&rsquo;re not only excellent professionals, but our delivery is also excellent. We help our clients understand their businesses, and in general, our added value goes beyond coding and designing.</li>
<li><strong>Balance in everything</strong>: Going the extra mile is not working more hours. We want everyone in the team to have a good work-life balance and enjoy working here. We might face pressing deadlines and complicated projects, but finding balance between reaching our goals and doing quality work is key to our success.</li>
