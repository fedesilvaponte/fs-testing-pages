We build great software, but we base our success on whether it helps your business grow.&amp;quot;
This simple phrase is enough to represent who we are and what we do. We are technical experts that build great software products, but what really set us apart from others, is the close relationship with our clients and our ability to help them use technology to generate positive impact in their businesses.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://example.org/docs/handbook/how-we-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/docs/handbook/how-we-work/</guid><description>How We Work # Among other things, it&amp;rsquo;s likely you are here with us because of our way of working.
We do our best to ensure that everybody can work however and wherever they think is more convenient, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we make remote working a standard practice in the company. &amp;ldquo;Work from anywhere&amp;rdquo; is not a trend or something inevitable we were forced to do; it&amp;rsquo;s just another practice we have to achieve work-life balance.</description></item></channel></rss>
