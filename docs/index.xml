We do our best to ensure that everybody can work however and wherever they think is more convenient, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we make remote working a standard practice in the company. &amp;ldquo;Work from anywhere&amp;rdquo; is not a trend or something inevitable we were forced to do; it&amp;rsquo;s just another practice we have to achieve work-life balance.</description></item><item><title>TESTIOng</title><link>https://fedesilvaponte.github.io/fs-testing-pages/test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fedesilvaponte.github.io/fs-testing-pages/test/</guid><description>This is a test page #</description></item></channel></rss>
